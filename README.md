# FRC District Coverage Analysis

A powerful command-line tool for FIRST Robotics Competition (Füì° Using The Blue Alliance API
   Year: 2025
   District: FMA
Fetching 2025 FMA district events from The Blue Alliance.

## üîß Technical Details

This tool uses a **greedy set cover algorithm** to find the minimum number of teams needed to cover all district events. The algorithm:

1. Always includes your specified team first
2. Iteratively selects teams that cover the most uncovered events
3. Applies constraints (team number limits, exclusions)
4. Generates multiple alternative solutions for flexibility

**Note**: District championship events are automatically excluded because:
- Championships are culminating events where teams compete for advancement
- Regular scouting alliances are typically formed for qualifying events
- Championship attendance is determined by district points, not pre-planned partnerships8 total events in FMA district

## What It Does

The district coverage analysis tool answers the question: **"What's the minimum number of teams needed to scout every match at every district event?"**

- **Finds Optimal Partnerships**: Calculates the minimum teams needed for full district coverage
- **Includes Your Team**: Ensures your team is always included in solutions
- **Generates Alternatives**: Provides multiple viable team combinations for flexibility
- **Respects Constraints**: Filters teams by number ranges and exclusion lists
- **Live Data**: Fetches current data directly from The Blue Alliance API

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Internet connection (for API usage)

### Installation

1. **Clone this repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/frc-district-coverage-analysis.git
   cd frc-district-coverage-analysis
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Get a Blue Alliance API key**
   - Visit https://www.thebluealliance.com/account
   - Create a free account and generate an API key

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Analyze your district for the current season
python multiple_coverage_analysis.py 3314 --api-key YOUR_API_KEY --year 2025 --district fma
```

Replace:
- `3314` with your team number
- `YOUR_API_KEY` with your Blue Alliance API key
- `fma` with your district abbreviation (or your district's abbreviation)

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Basic analysis using Blue Alliance API
python multiple_coverage_analysis.py 3314 --api-key YOUR_KEY --year 2025 --district fma

# Limit to specific team number ranges
python multiple_coverage_analysis.py 1089 --api-key YOUR_KEY --year 2025 --district fma --max-team 6000

# Exclude teams that can't participate
python multiple_coverage_analysis.py 3314 --api-key YOUR_KEY --year 2025 --district fma --exclude-teams 1234 5678

# Find multiple alternative solutions
python multiple_coverage_analysis.py 3314 --api-key YOUR_KEY --year 2025 --district fma --max-solutions 3

# Include specific high-numbered teams while limiting others
python multiple_coverage_analysis.py 3314 --max-team 6000 --include-teams 10123 11456

# Using local JSON files (offline mode)
python multiple_coverage_analysis.py 3314
```

## Command Line Options

| Option | Description | Default | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|---------|
| `team_number` | Your team number (required) | - | `3314` |
| `--api-key` | Blue Alliance API key | None | `--api-key abc123...` |
| `--year` | Competition year (with API) | None | `--year 2025` |
| `--district` | District abbreviation (with API) | None | `--district fma` |
| `--max-team` | Maximum team number to consider | 12000 | `--max-team 6000` |
| `--max-solutions` | Number of alternative solutions | 5 | `--max-solutions 3` |
| `--exclude-teams` | Teams to exclude from analysis | None | `--exclude-teams 1234 5678` |
| `--include-teams` | Teams to include beyond max limit | None | `--include-teams 10123 11456` |

**Note**: When using `--api-key`, you must also provide `--year` and `--district`

### Team Filtering Options

- **`--max-team`**: Sets an upper limit on team numbers (useful for focusing on established teams)
- **`--exclude-teams`**: Removes specific teams from consideration (teams that can't participate)
- **`--include-teams`**: Includes specific teams even if they exceed the `--max-team` limit (for newer teams you want to work with)

Example: `--max-team 6000 --include-teams 10123 11456` will consider teams 1-6000 plus teams 10123 and 11456.

```json
[
  {
    "team_number": 3314,
    "nickname": "Mechanical Mustangs",
    "school_name": "Clifton High School",
    "city": "Clifton",
    "state_prov": "New Jersey",
    "website": "http://cliftonrobotics.org"

## Use Cases

**For Team Captains:**
- Plan scouting alliances before the season starts
- Find backup teams if original partners can't commit
- Identify teams attending the same events as yours

**For District Event Coordinators:**
- Help teams organize comprehensive scouting coverage
- Facilitate connections between teams for data sharing
- Optimize resource allocation across the district

**For Competition Strategy:**
- Ensure no matches go unscoured in your district
- Build relationships with teams for playoff alliance selection
- Share scouting workload efficiently across multiple events

## Building Scouting Alliances

Once you have your optimal team list:

1. **Contact Teams**: Reach out to teams in your preferred solution
2. **Establish Protocols**: Agree on data formats and sharing methods
3. **Assign Responsibilities**: Determine which team scouts which events
4. **Share Data**: Use scouting apps with data transfer features
5. **Coordinate Strategy**: Share insights and analysis across the alliance

## Technical Details

This tool uses a **greedy set cover algorithm** to find the minimum number of teams needed to cover all district events. The algorithm:

1. Always includes your specified team first
2. Iteratively selects teams that cover the most uncovered events
3. Applies constraints (team number limits, exclusions)
4. Generates multiple alternative solutions for flexibility

## Troubleshooting

**API Errors:**
- Verify your API key is correct
- Check that the district abbreviation is valid
- Ensure the year exists in The Blue Alliance database

**No Solutions Found:**
- Your team might not participate in enough events
- Try increasing `--max-team` limit
- Check if excluded teams are preventing solutions

**Import Errors:**
- Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Ensure Python 3.7+ is installed
